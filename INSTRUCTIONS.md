# Take-home Assessment

## Background

Tim Cook came to our team with an urgent request - build a one-page form to collect a list of all active super secret projects at Apple.

INSTRUCTIONS

Timebox this exercise to 1-2 hours, you do not have to complete this exercise fully. It’s intentionally vague because we’re interested in how you approach solving this problem.
Email a zip file of your solution, we will review, and then schedule a follow up Technical Interview.

THE CHALLENGE: Build a form to collect the following inputs and save them into a database. Email/notifications are out of scope.

Project super secret code: (validation rules: the name always starts with 3 uppercase alpha characters followed by 3 numeric characters, and separated by a hyphen, no other special characters are allowed)

If the team decides to move you forward in the process they will expect you to have your solution running locally for the Technical Interview, where you will share your screen and walk us through your work while we ask questions - we’ll try to mimic what it would feel like to work together with our team.

If you have questions, write them down and we can talk through them during the interview. If you are blocked, do what you can to move forward and don’t worry too much.
